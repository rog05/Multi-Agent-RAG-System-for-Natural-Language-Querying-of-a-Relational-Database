# Multi-Agent-RAG-System-for-Natural-Language-Querying-of-a-Relational-Database


🧠 Multi-Agent RAG System – Chat with Your Database
This is a simple web app where you can ask questions in English, and it will talk to your database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite) and give you answers using AI (Groq + LangChain).

✅ What This App Can Do
Ask questions like “How many customers joined last year?”

Works with SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL

Breaks the task into smart steps (agents):

Find the right tables

Write the SQL query

Run the query

Turn the result into a human answer

Shows helpful messages if something goes wrong

Easy-to-use web interface using Streamlit

🧠 Behind the Scenes (Agents Used)
🧩 Schema Agent – finds which tables and columns to use

💡 SQL Generator – writes the SQL query using Groq AI

🧮 Retriever – runs the query and gets results

📄 Synthesizer – gives you a nice human answer

⚠️ Handles Errors Like
Table not found

Bad SQL

No data found

And shows a helpful message instead of crashing.


##📦 Optional Improvements
